# Software-Security
Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

The client, Artemis Financial, wants to modernize their operations. They have a RESTful API and request our expertise in protecting it with the most current and effective software security methods.

What did you do well when finding your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it essential to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being? 

I was able to research and update dependencies very well. Secure Code is critical to protecting company and client information and assets. Appropriately implemented software security saves the company time and money.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The manual code review was the most challenging but rewarding to learn.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I implemented secure coding practices and utilized static testing tools like Maven Dependency Check. I will use the strategies I have learned from this class in the future.

How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used the Vulnerability Assessment Process Flow Diagram to assess possible vulnerabilities, performed a manual code review and refactoring, and performed static testing with Maven Dependency Check. All of these tools will be helpful in the future.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work you have completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I have uploaded one of our projects for review.
